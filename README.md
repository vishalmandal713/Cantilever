# Project 1 --Inventory Management System #
This is a simple console-based project made in C++ to help manage products in a store or warehouse. It lets you add new products, view all products, search by product ID, update product details, and delete products. All the data is saved in a text file(inventory.txt) so you don’t lose anything when the program is closed.

# Project 2 --Number Guessing Game #
This is a fun console game made using C++. The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and your job is to guess it. After each guess, the game tells you if your guess is too high or too low. You keep guessing until you get it right. It also shows how many tries you took.
This project uses basic C++, input/output (cin, cout), random number generation, and time functions. It’s a great beginner project to learn how to use loops, conditions, and user input in C++.
